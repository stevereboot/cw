# In-house Coding Workshops

The goal of these workshops is to introduce students to the world of coding, in a fun, exciting environment.  Students will learn the fundamentals of coding by working in teams and completing a series of projects.  Also, students will learn from different room-wide events that will take place every hour.  These events will introduce cutting edge domains in computer science, such as big data and machine learning- with an emphasis on how Bloomberg L.P. uses these fields to provide value to our customers.  Guest speakers, videos, terminal demonstrations will be part of these events.  Finally, student teams will have an opportunity to present their version of the final project, which emphasizes creativity and presentation skills.

## Outline
### Overview
- Workshop Days: 3 consecutive Saturdays [Target dates in July 2016]
- Workshop Hours: 10am to 4pm with 1hr Lunch at noon
- Room: Training room on LL2 (plus higher floor for lunch)
- Number of Students: 60
- Number of Trainers: 15

### Pre-Workshop
- Pre-work: Online introduction to the workshop environment and a multiple choice questionaire designed to assess motivation and skill level
- Table assignment: Trainers will be matched with skill levels to ensure best learning environment for students

### During Workshop
- 5 hours of training per day
- Pair programming
- Each trainer will have 2 pairs and sit between them (Pair, Trainer, Pair)
- 2+ projects per day (first 2 sessions), 1 final on last day (with team presentations/awards/superlatives)
- Breaks every hour, for room-wide events, interactive activities and mixers
 - Breaks will be 5 minutes, followed by a 15 min room-wide event
 - Topics designed to expose students to real-life computer science domains, what its like to be professional developers, how Bloomberg uses developers and researchers to build better products and give value to customers.

### Between Workshops
- Homework to reinforce topics learned (leverage Codecon)
- Preview of next assignment to allow for self-study and research

### After Workshop
- Opportunities for mentoring
- Continuing education: Access to extra projects
- Events for program alumni - One day Hackathon (also invite some students from other Startup programs to attend)

### Curriculum
- Language: Python
- Projects: 4 + 1 final
 - Projects are part of a single application
 - Students will insert code snippets defining application logic, resources and interaction
 - Students will also need to read and understand existing code
- Environment: Cloud9 with prior account setup (1 account per pair, created ahead of time- bbcoding01, bbcoding02, etc)
 - Accessible to students between and after workshops to use as a learning reference
  
## Next Steps
- Choose a name!
- Branch working group into sub-groups to work on projects and curriculum
